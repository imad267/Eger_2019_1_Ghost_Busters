# 2. Use cases
user cases: 1. User opens the app via a web_page. 2. The user creates an account with a username and password(entered twice for comparison). 3. When finished, the user can log out. 

# 3. What it should be, what it should not be
what it should be, what it should not be. It should organize users tasks. It should not become a task in itself and end up complicating the user's initial tasks.

# 4. Constraints on the system
constraints on the systems (laws, standards) GDPR: The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area.
