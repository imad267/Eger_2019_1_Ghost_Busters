# 1. Introduction

Some paragraph.

## 1.1 Purpose

## 1.2 Intended Audience

## 1.3 Scope

The project scope is mostly defined by the size of our team. Our team is just big enough to to support a FullStack development of a simple project. Our manpower will be able to manage the full course of the development.

Monetary wise our project scope is zeroed, meaning we will use free and already available tools for the development.

Time wise our project scope is extremely restricted. We should allow documentation work until the end of October, then the actual development must begin.
